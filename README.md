# obsidian-sort-lines

Sorts lines in Obsidian. Never gets tired.

## Features

Adds just two commands: "Sort lines ascending" and "Sort lines descending" as seen in VS Code. Only sorts your selected text, never the entire file. No settings, no configuration. If you need more advanced sorting and line manipulation features, check out the [Sort and Permute lines](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-sort-and-permute-lines) plugin.
